# cutup

This jquery plug-in is a tool to help the front end developer in the cutup process.

It has been designed to assist front-end like me to get the cutup right.

It should:
Grab a image (done on photoshop / GIMP / Paint) and use it as a guide in your HTML element.

This way it should be easier to spot where your CSS starts to differ from the design. 

You can increase / decrease the opacity of your targeted element if you need to compare it with your guide.

## Documentation

cutup.js comes a couple of handy shortcuts:

- (cmd + click) on the element: set the element to active mode. Display the image as a guideline.
- (shift + '+') increase opacity of all active elements.
- (shift + '-') decrease opacity of all active elements.

## Note 

- This plugin is more design for cutup pages.
- It only works on element present on the page on page load.
