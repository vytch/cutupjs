# cutup

This jquery plug-in is a tool to help the front end developer in the cutup process.

It has been designed to assist front-end like me to get the cutup right.

It should:
Grab a image (done on photoshop / GIMP / Paint) and use it as a guide in your HTML element.

This way it should be easier to spot where your CSS starts to differ from the design. 

You can increase / decrease the opacity of your targeted element if you need to compare it with your guide.
